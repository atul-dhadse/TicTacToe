The AI’s algorithm has the following steps:
1. See if there’s a move the computer can make that will win the game. If there is, make that move. Otherwise, go to step 2. 
2. See if there’s a move the player can make that will cause the computer to lose the game. If there is, move there to block the player. Otherwise, go to step 3. 
3. Check if any of the corner spaces (spaces 1, 3, 7, or 9) are free. If so, move there. If no corner space is free, go to step 4.
4. Check if the center is free. If so, move there. If it isn’t, go to step 5. 
5. Move on any of the side spaces (spaces 2, 4, 6, or 8). There are no more steps because the side spaces are all that’s left if the execution reaches step 5.
